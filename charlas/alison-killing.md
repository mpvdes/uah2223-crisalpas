She investigated Xinjiang region and checked where there were forced labour camps. They found that the Chinese were building these camps through satellite imagery using Baidu, Chinese Google Street Maps equivalent.

As the places were crossed out in Baidu, they went back to Google Maps and found what was there. She uses Google Earth Pro so she can observe how a specific place changes throughout time. Furthermore, they used Sentinel and European Space Agency data (which offers information every couple of days), and they compiled the data with Excel.

All of the information was public, except the interviews that were done with detainees. They mostly used open source content.

First, they wanted to find the camps, so that's what they did, but as they got too much information, they wanted to show it. They were realising things to tell while the process was going.
